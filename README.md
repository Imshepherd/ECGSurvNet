# ECGSurvNet

ECGSurvNet is a deep survival neural network for predicting mortality risk from electrocardiogram (ECG). This repository demonstrates how to train and test ECGSurvNet on the open ECG dataset. ECGSurvNet predicts the patientâ€™s risk of death from the waveform of ECG, which trained using the equations of Cox proportional hazards model as the loss function. The SaMi-Trop cohort is used as the training and validation dataset, which is an open dataset with annotations of mortality and the correspondent ECG traces.

# Requirements

  * [R (version 3.4.4)](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio (not necessary)](https://www.rstudio.com/)
  * [Rtools (Rtools35.exe)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/history.html)
  
  You may need to have `Rtools` installed to compile the package. Use the above link for the installation of `Rtools`.

  * [MXNetR (version 1.3.0)](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.3.1/install/index.html?platform=Windows&language=R&processor=CPU)
  
  You need to have `mxnet` to train and inference the deep learning model. You can install CPU verions of `mxnet` by running the following line in your R console:
  
  ```R
  cran <- getOption("repos")
  cran["dmlc"] <- "https://apache-mxnet.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/R/CRAN/"
  options(repos = cran)
  install.packages("mxnet")
  ```
  
# Data preparation
  
We use the [SaMi-Trop dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4905618#.Yduo4MlBxPa) as the example data.
